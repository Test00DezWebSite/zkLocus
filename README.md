# zkLocus: ZK-SNARKSs Powered Geolocation Privacy Service

zkLocus enables users to authenticate their geographical location with service providers while preserving their privacy. Powered by Zero-knowledge proofs, users can verify being within a certain region, following a certain path, or being outside a specified area, without revealing their precise coordinates. This balance of data utility and privacy allows businesses, applications and products to access the user’s location and personalize services without infringing on user privacy.

## Problem Statement

In the modern, digitally connected world, users often exchange sensitive information such as geolocation data with online service providers for more personalized experiences. However, this often raises serious privacy concerns. With numerous applications like Google products, Instagram, and Twitter relying on user's real-time location data, the threat to personal privacy is ever-growing. Current use-cases, in many instances, require nothing more than confirmation of a user's presence within a specific geographic area or during a certain time interval. Some scenarios may even need the exact opposite – verification that a user is not within a particular area, such as adhering to EU's cookie consent policy. Thus, a solution is needed that allows users to maintain control over their location data, determining its granularity and access to it. Our solution, zkLocus, offers users the ability to share their location privately with third parties, maintaining full control over the information's detail and its distribution.

## Solution

Leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs with point-in-polygon analysis, zkLocus enables users to verify their presence within a specific geographic polygon, such as a city or a country, to a third party without disclosing their exact location. By adjusting the polygon's size, users control the granularity of their location data, ensuring more significant privacy for broader areas. Therefore, users have complete control over the precision of their shared location data, eliminating the need to trust third-party data storage and processing practices. Meanwhile, service providers can continue utilizing the advantages of location-based customization without breaching user privacy. 

zkLocus also features location history stored in a Merkle Tree, allowing users to prove they have followed a specific path without revealing their exact coordinates. This feature is especially beneficial for organizations needing to validate that employees or company vehicles have stayed within designated geographical boundaries while preserving privacy. For instance, a car rental company can ensure a rented vehicle hasn't left the agreed-upon country without ever knowing its exact location. 

Furthermore, zkLocus can confirm a user's presence at a location within a specified time interval, offering even greater privacy preservation. For example, a user can demonstrate they were in New York between January 1st and January 7th, 2024, without giving any additional location specifics. This powerful blend of data utility and privacy protection positions zkLocus as an innovative solution to one of the digital world's most challenging problems – ensuring privacy in an age of information.
